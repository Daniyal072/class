<p><hr><marquee bgcolor="red">If you could write a book that takes place thirty years in the future, how would you do it? Well, Ray Bradbury describes how he sees humanity in the future with his very successful novel: The Martian Chronicles. This novel was first published in the 1950, meaning that the story took place almost 50 years in the future. I got to read the updated version which was published in 1997, so the stories that I read take place about 33 years in the future. The Martian Chronicles is a novel filled with many short stories and inter chapters all linked together. This stories narrate the colonizations of Mars by people fleeing from planet Earth. Earth is described as unstable planet with nuclear meltdowns and huge radiations zones due to nuclear war. This causes humans to take over a new planet, which in this case is Mars. Bradbury originally published mini science fiction stories during the 1940s. This story were later put together with extra material to create this sensational novel. Bradbury sets the novel in a time very distant from the present so he could use the ideas of new technology such as rocket ships, landings on Mars and many more advance technology that were just ideas during the 1950s. Still, it’s quite peculiar how he didn’t set the time very far enough were we still wouldn't have figured out some of those pressing present global-civilization issues: nuclear war. In this essay I will be talking about the physical setting Ray Bradbury created and how he was able to adapt it to the story and describe it as best as he could.  I will talk how setting is related to the author. I will also talk about the primary locations in the novel and how realistic where they. Finally I will discuss how the main characters fit in the main setting</p></marquee><hr>
